              <h1>Impacts</h1>
              <p>The Rubber Ducky relies on the fact that, at some level, user input must be trusted. At a computer without this trust, no one would ever be able to do anything, so it would be useless. This means security is necessarily limited, and the Rubber Ducky exploits this by masquerading as user input. The impact of this is that security now requires mechanisms to verify user input, or otherwise prevent malicious input from ever entering the system. Antivirus software, firewalls, and network management are all bypassed, so another layer of security becomes necesary.</p>
              <p>The Rubber Ducky, if programmed well, is very difficult to distinguish from user input. Effectively, anything a user could legitimately do or gain access to, the Ducky can as well. A typical exploitation of a computer starts with some security flaw and builds up to gaining control of a user account. The Ducky bypasses all of this and gives the attacker direct control of the user account, temporarily. Thus, the only limits on the damage are limits that apply to normal users, once the attacker has access to the machine.</p>
              <p> Dangerous and hilarious Ducky script favorites: </p>

              <p>All of these scripts are easily searchable on the web, and the Ducky itself only costs $45. <i><b>Please watch out for your USB ports, they provide IMMEDIATE access to your computer.</b></i>
              <h3>Limitations of USB Security</h3>
              <p>At first glance, the opportunities to use a Rubber Ducky might seem limited, as it does require physical access to the target machine. After closer examination, however, the versatility of this system becomes clear. To begin with, people use a variety of computers to which almost everyone has access. How many people check the USB ports of a library computer they just started? How often have you left your computer running while you went to the bathroom, or not paid attention to it while you talked to someone else? USB ports are generally designed to be easy to access, in order to make them easier to use and improve the user experience, but this makes it easier for <u>everyone</u> to access, not just the intended user. </p>

              <p>The Rubber Ducky escalates the significance of a short period of access to an unattended machine. Inherent in our thinking when we leave a machine on and unattended is the question "What could happen in a few minutes?". With the Ducky, the answer changes from "Nothing Significant" to "Whatever the Attacker Wants."

The ability to script <a class="ref" href="https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---WiFi-password-grabber">grabbing credentials</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---OSX-Passwordless-SSH-access-%28ssh-keys%29">changing ssh keys</a>, or even <a class="ref" href="https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---OS-X-Wget-and-Execute">downloading and executing arbitrary files</a>, and have those scripts execute rapidly on the target machine, grants the attacker enormous power. </p>
